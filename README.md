# odin-testing-practice

The Testing Practice assignment from The Odin Project's Javascript course.

This was a great assignment for my first time writing Jest tests. 

It helped me to write thorough code being that you need to think about the results first of what you want your function to return. It also forces you to think of alternate and edge cases to your function so that you can write if statements and throw errors as needed.

It was also some needed basic Javascript practice - that's always appreciated.
